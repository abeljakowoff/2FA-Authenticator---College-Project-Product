# 2FA-Authenticator---College-Project-Product

Welcome. 

This is a two-factor authentication program that allows you to generate one-time passwords by both time and counter.

Since this is my project product in college, DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM AS A MAINTENANCE PROGRAM FOR 2-FACTOR AUTHENTIFICATION. The program saves the accounts created in it in .json files without any encryption.

This repository has only one Python file which runs the program using the Tk library.

Run the file with Python version 3.7 or higher.
